# LeetCode Solutions in Java

This repository contains my solutions to **LeetCode** problems, implemented in Java.  
All problems are organized in a single folder and named using the following pattern:
No topic subfolders â€” just one directory sorted by **problem number**.

---

## Naming Convention
- File name: `<ProblemName><Number>.java`
- Examples:
  - `TwoSum1.java`
  - `BinarySearch704.java`
  - `ReverseLinkedList206.java`

This makes it easy to **find by problem ID**.

---

## Find a Solution by Number
From the repo root:
```bash
ls src/LeetCode | grep 704       # BinarySearch704.java
